# Assignment 1
## Write a C++ program that does the following.
- [x] Create a class named "Matrix" which has the following:
- [x] A 2-dimensonal array (public or private) of size 3X3.
- [x] Define a constructor which assigns random values to an array.
- [x] Public method to print the array to the console as a matrix.
- [x] Overload the following constructors: * and ==
      - Multiplication (*) – when two or more objects of the Matrix class are multiplied,
        this method returns a Matrix object whose array holds the product of the
        myArray of the multiplied objects.
      - Equal (==) – two matrix objects are equal if and only if the array of each
        Matrix object are the same. This method returns a Boolean value.
